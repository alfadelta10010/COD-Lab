Observation - single cycle:

storing the base address of the word data in register then storing the data in registers 
with help of base address and offset value the addition of the two register is performed

#2nd
#Write an Assembly Program for addition of 2 half words

.data                                                  
a: .half 0X1122,0X1111,0

la x10,a 
lh x11,0(x10)
lh x12,2(x10)
add x13,x11,x12 
sh x13,4(x10)

Observation - single cycle:
The code defines a data section with an array a containing two 16-bit values, 0x1122 and 0x1111 , then loads the address of this array into register x10, and retrieves the two halfword values from the array into registers x11 and x12.
The code adds the values in x11 and x12, stores the result in x13, and then saves this result as a halfword at the memory address a+4. 

Register mapping:
x10 0x10000000
x11 0x00001122
x12 0x00001111
x13 0x00002233

#3rd
#Write an Assembly Program for addition of 2 bytes

.data 
a: .byte 0x77, 0x00      
.text
la x10, a            
lb x11, 0(x10)      
lb x12, 2(x10)      
add x13, x11, x12    
sb x13, 4(x10)

Observation -single cycle:
This assembly code adds two bytes from memory and stores the result. The first byte, '0x77', is loaded into 'x11', but the second load 'lb x12, 2(x10)' attempts to access a byte beyond the initialized data, likely loading 0x00 (since it's out of bounds). The sum '0x77' is stored at an address offset by 4 bytes from 'a'.

Register mapping:
x10 0x10000000
x11 0x00000077
x12 0x00000000
x13 0x00000077

Data mapping:
0x10000004 0x00000077
0x10000000 0x00000077

    lb x21, 0(x20)            # Load 8-bit signed byte from address in x20 into x21

Observation:
The assembly code demonstrates storing and loading various data types. It shows how a 32-bit unsigned word (0x0000ABCD, 43981) is loaded into x11, and a 32-bit signed word (0x80001234, -2147483644) into x13. It also handles 16-bit data, with an unsigned half-word (0xABCD, 43981) loaded into x15 and a signed half-word (0x8001, -32767) into x17. Finally, for 8-bit data, it loads an unsigned byte (0xAB, 171) into x19 and a signed byte (0x80, -128) into x21.
