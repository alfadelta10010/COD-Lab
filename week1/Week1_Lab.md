# Program 1: 
### Statement: Write an Assembly Program for addition of 2 words

### Name of file:
program1.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
-THE DATA TYPE IS WORD SO THE OFFSET VALUE IS 4 
 THE BASE ADRESS IS STORED IN x10
 THE OPERANDS ARE x11,x12,x13 AND OPERATIONS TO BE PERFORMED IS la,lw,add,sw
 THE TWO SOURCE OPERANDS ARE x11 AND x12,GIVEN VALUES BY USING THE OFFSET VALUES, ADD OPERATION PERFORMS THE ADDITION OF BOTH OPERANDS AND STORES THE RESULT IN x13
