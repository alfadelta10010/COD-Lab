# Program 1: 
### Statement: Write an Assembly Program for addition of 2 words

### Name of file:
Week1_Lab.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
-Load the base address into register x18.
-Load two word(32 bits) from memory into registers x19 and x20.x19 and x20 are at offsets 0 and 4 from the base address respectively.
-Add the two values stored in x19 and x20, store the result in register x21, and write this sum back into memory at offset 8 from the base address.

### Name of file:
Week1_Lab.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
-Load the base address into register x18.
-Load two half word(16 bits) from memory into registers x19 and x20.x19 and x20 are at offsets 0 and 2 from the base address respectively.
-Add the two values stored in x19 and x20, store the result in register x21, and write this sum back into memory at offset 4 from the base address.

# Program 4: 
### Statement: Write an Assembly Program and analyse the format of storing signed and unsigned words, half words and byte data types

### Name of file:
Week1_Lab.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
-Load the base address of the data at label a into register x10, then load two words/half words/bytes into registers x18 and x19.
-Add these two values, store the result at a (4,2,1)-byte offset, then load the original values again as signed, storing the result.
-Add these two values again, store the result at a (4,2,1)-byte offset, then load the original values again as unsigned, storing the result in different memory location.Compare the outputs to view the difference between signed and unsigned.
