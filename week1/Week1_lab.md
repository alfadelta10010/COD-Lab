### Name of file:
Week1_prog1.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
- Loads two words from memory.
- Adds the two words and stores the result in a register.
- Stores the result back in memory.

### Register Mapping
- *x1:* Address of 'a'
- *x2:* First word from 'a'
- *x3:* Second word from 'a'
- *x4:* Result of the addition

### Data Mapping
- *0x80000002:* First Word
- *0x9123456A:* Second Word
- *Result stored at address a+8*

# Program 2: 
### Statement: Write an Assembly Program for addition of 2 half words

### Name of file:
Week1_prog2.s
### Observation - Single Cycle
- Loads two half words from memory.

- Stores the result back in memory.

### Register Mapping
- *x1:* Address of 'a'
- *x2:* First half-word from 'a'
- *x3:* Second half-word from 'a'
- *x4:* Result of the addition

### Data Mapping
- *0x0002:* First Half Word
- *0x456A:* Second Half Word
- *Result stored at address a+4*

# Program 3:

- *Result stored at address a+2*

# Program 4:

### Statement:
Write an assembly program that performs arithmetic operations on signed and unsigned words, half-words, and bytes, and stores the results back in memory.

### Name of file:
Week1_prog4.s
### Observation - Single Cycle
	•	The program loads two 32-bit words from memory (a[0] and a[1]), adds them, and stores the result in a[2].
	•	The program loads two 16-bit signed half-words from memory (b[0] and b[1]), adds them, and stores the result in b[2].
	•	The program loads two 8-bit signed bytes from memory (c[0] and c[1]), adds them, and stores the result in c[2].
Register Mapping
	•	x10: Base address of array a or b
	•	x11: Base address of array c
	•	x2: Value stored in a[0] (0x80000112)
	•	x3: Value stored in a[1] (0x9123456C)
	•	x12: Value stored in b[0] (0x8002) or c[0] (0x82)
	•	x13: Value stored in b[1] (0x456A) or c[1] (0x6A)
	•	x14: Result of addition operations
Data Mapping
	•	a[0]: 0x80000112
	•	a[1]: 0x9123456C
	•	a[2]: Result of 0x80000112 + 0x9123456C = 0x000000f8
	•	b[0]: 0x8002
	•	b[1]: 0x456A
	•	b[2]: Result of 0x8002 + 0x456A 
	•	c[0]: 0x82
	•	c[1]: 0x6A
	•	c[2]: Result of 0x82 + 0x6A
