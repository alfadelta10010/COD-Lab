# Observation - Single Cycle
 The elements of array a[11] is stored in the data memory with the base address of the array in register x5. a[10] is the 11th element in the array and initially it is having the value 0. Each element of the array is of size half word (unsigned short int).
since we have not yet learnt the looping statements, I have written the code without looping instructions. First the values from the data memory are loaded into respective registers (due to load and store architecture of RISC V). Then the value of h in memory is changed 10 times according to the c code as mentioned above and finally stored in a[10] (i.e, stored after an offset of 20 to the base address of a)
The value of h would change in each iteration by accessing each array element and adding it to the previous value of h (h = h + a[i]), as described in the code with the help of temporary registers.
The final value of h stored in memory is also of the size 2 bytes. (if a carry was generated and the number exceeds the half word size then only the 2 bytes of data from the LSB side wouldbe stored back to the memory.
x7 stores the h value after all the iterations as specified by the for loop

# Observation - Single Cycle
For the first 64 bit , we are storing it in 2 memory locations (each 32bit size). Similarly the second 64 bit number is stored. The LSB half of the first number is stored in register x5 and for the second number, it is stored in register x7. The MSB half of the first number is stored in register x6 and for the second number, it is stored in x28.
 I used the sltu command here to compare if the value of x30 (value of x5+x7) is less than the value of x5. If true then value 1 is stored in register x26( which is the carry bit that needs to be added with the MSB half addition.
Similarly the 2 MSB halves are added with each other and also with the register x26.
The final 64 bit number can be read from registers x25( for MSB half) and x30( for LSB half). The final carry( if it exists) will be stored in register x27.
I have considered addition of 2 unsigned numbers.
