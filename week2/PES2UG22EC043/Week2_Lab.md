# Program 1: 
### Statement: Convert the given C program into RV32I assembly

### Name of file:
loop.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
- The address of the array is loaded into the x10 register using "la"
- The first element of the array is loaded and added with the x0 register (initial value of h is 0) and the result is stored in the x6 register
- Subsequent elements are loaded and added with value stored in x6
- Final result is then stored in the 11th element of the array using "sh"
 
### Register Mapping
- **x10:** 0x10000000
- **x5:** 0x00000008 (this is just the last element loaded to this register)
- **x6:** 0x000068d0

### Data Mapping
- **0x10000000:** 0x56781234 (first two elements of the array)
- **0x10000004:** 0x00020001 (next two elements of the array and so on)
- **0x10000008:** 0x00040003
- **0x1000000c:** 0x00060005
- **0x10000010:** 0x00080007
- **0x10000014:** 0x000068d0 (final result)


# Program 2: 
### Statement: Add two 64bit numbers using RV32I

### Name of file:
64bit_carry.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
- Four "lw" operations are used to load two 64-bit numbers
- Addition is performed on the 16 least significant bits of the numbers, and sltu is used to check if a carry was generated
- The same is repeated with the 16 most significant bits of the numbers
- The carry generated from the LSBs is then added to the result of the MSB addition
- Since a carry can be generated while adding the LSB carry or while adding the 16 MSBs, sltu is used twice to check for carries, and the results are ORed to obtain the final carry value
- Three "lw" operations are used to store the 64 bit result and the carry
 
### Register Mapping
- **x5:** 0x00000001 (Carry generated by addition of 16 least significant bits)
- **x6:** 0xfffffffe (Result of addition of 16 most significant bits)
- **x11:** 0xffffffff (Next four registers contain the 64 bit numbers)
- **x12:** 0xffffffff
- **x13:** 0xffffffff
- **x13:** 0xffffffff
- **x14:** 0xfffffffe (Result of addition of 16 least significant bits, next three registers contain the result)
- **x15:** 0xffffffff (Result of addition of x5 and x6)
- **x15:** 0x00000001 (Final carry value)

### Data Mapping
- **0x10000000:** 0xffffffff 
- **0x10000004:** 0xffffffff 
- **0x10000008:** 0xffffffff 
- **0x1000000c:** 0xffffffff 
- **0x10000010:** 0xfffffffe
- **0x10000014:** 0xffffffff 
- **0x10000018:** 0x00000001
