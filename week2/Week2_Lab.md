# Program 1: 
### Statement: Write an Assembly Program for the following C code:
main() {
	unsigned short int a[11] = {0x1234, 0x5678, ...}, h;
	h = 0;
	for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	{
		h = h + a[i];
	}
	a[10] = h;
}

### Observation - Single Cycle
To be done in Class Yet
On sir instruction will upload this and the following parts for program-1 later

# Program 2: 
### Statement: 2. Write an Assembly Program for addition of 2 64-bit numbers on RV32I 

### Name of file:
CtoAssembly.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
- Dividing the 64b into 2 32b's number
- Adding the LSB's of both the numbers 
- Checking carry as well
- Adding the MSB's of both the number 
- Checking for carry again
- Adding the MSB added results with carry
 
### Register Mapping
- x10 : Stores the address of n
- x11 : Stores the LSB of No.1
- x12 : Stores the MSB of No.1
- x13 : Stores the LSB of No.2
- x14 : Stores the MSB of No.2
- x15 : Adding x11 and x 13
- x16 : Carry for the above addition
- x17 : Adding x12 with x14, adding the caary generated above and storing the result
- x18 : Carry generated by MSB
- x20 : Stroes the Results obtained my addition of LSB,MSB and the final carry 

### Data Mapping
- x10 : 0x10000000
- x11 : 0xffffffff
- x12 : 0xffffffff
- x13 : 0xffffffff
- x14 : 0xffffffff
- x15 : 0xfffffffe
- x16 : 0x00000001
- x17 : 0xffffffff
- x18 : 0x00000001
- x20 : 0x10000010
