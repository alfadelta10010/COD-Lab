# Program 1: 
### Statement:Write an Assembly Program for the following C code:
main() {
	unsigned short int a[11] = {0x1234, 0x5678, ...}, h;
	h = 0;
	for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	{
		h = h + a[i];
	}
	a[10] = h;
};

### Observation - Single Cycle
- The code adds two 64-bit integers stored in an array a. It splits each 64-bit integer into upper and lower 32-bit halves, performs addition on the lower halves, and then on the upper halves, accounting for any carry from the lower half addition. The results are stored back in memory at specified offsets in the array a, with the final carry stored separately.

### Observation - Single Cycle
*) The elements from two arrays `a` and `b` and stores the results in a third array `c`.
*) It iteratively loads elements from `a` and `b`, performs the addition, and stores the result back into `c`. The code processes five elements, using offsets to access each element in the arrays. The final state of array `c` contains the sums of the respective elements from `a` and `b`.
