# Program 1: 
### Statement:
Convert a 32-bit value from Little Endian to Big Endian format using RISC-V assembly

### Name of file:
week3code3.s

### Observation - Single Cycle
we load the word to be changed into a register
Shift Left by 8 bytes each time so that we can get the MSB to the left most part
Shift Right by 8 bytes so that we can get the LSB to the right the most side
we repeat until the numbers are stored in separate registers
Then we add all the registers in which the results of the shift right and shift left the values are stored 
get the final conversion
