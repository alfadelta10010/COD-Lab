# Program 1: 
### Statement:Write an assembly program to find whether a given string is a palindrome or not, using stack operations

### Name of file:
p1.s

### Observation - Explanation
The program pushes each character of the input string onto the stack.
It then compares each character from the string with the characters popped from the stack.
If all characters match, the program indicates the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it indicates it is not.

# Program 2: 
### Statement:Write an assembly program to search a given number in an array

### Name of file:
p2.s

### Observation - Explanation
The program loads the array and target number, then searches through each element of the array.
It compares each array element with the target, and if a match is found, sets x10 to 1.
If the target is not found after checking all elements, it sets x10 to 0 and exits.
