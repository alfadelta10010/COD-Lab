# Week 5 - Assembly Assignment
1. Write an assembly program to check whether a given number in an array of elements is divisible by 9
2. Write an Assembly Program for the following C code:
```c
main() {
	unsigned short int a[11] = {0x1234, 0x5678, ...};
	unsigned short int b[11] = {0x1234, 0x5678, ...};
	unsigned short int c[11] = {0x1234, 0x5678, ...};
	for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	{
		c[i] = a[i] * b[i] + c[i-1];
	}
}
```
